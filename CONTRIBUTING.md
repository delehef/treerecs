# Treerecs

This project uses a simplified
[gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model) workflow.

Development primarily takes place in dedicated feature branches that are 
derived from branch *dev* and can be merged back into *dev* when ready.

## Want the latest code ?
Please consider checking out the **dev** branch:

`git checkout dev`

## Want to contribute ?
Create your own feature branch and get started:

`git checkout -b <your feature's name> dev`
